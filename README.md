# Multiresolution Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (MRPOD)

## Introduction

Welcome to ``mrpod``, a Python module for carrying out Multiresolution Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of multi-dimensional time series. Please visit the [homepage](https://mrpod.readthedocs.io) for documentation and examples.

## Reference

This module was developed in parallel with the following publication:

Yin, Zhiyao, and Michael Stöhr. 2020. “Time–Frequency Localisation of Intermittent Dynamics in a Bistable Turbulent Swirl Flame.” _Journal of Fluid Mechanics_ 882. Cambridge University Press: A30. doi:10.1017/jfm.2019.762.

This paper contains detailed mathematical derivations of the MRPOD method as well as a practical application in turbulent reacting flows. It is available as open access [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2019.762).
