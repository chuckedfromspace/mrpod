Greetings
=========

Welcome to the documentation of the Python module ``mrpod`` for performing
Multiresolution Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (MRPOD) of multi-dimensional
data series (vector and scalar) obtained in turbulent flows.

Why ``mrpod``
=============
Data-driven, modal-decomposition techniques such as POD (also known as the
Principle Component Analysis, PCA) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) have
been widely implemented to extract periodic, coherent structures in turbulent flows.
